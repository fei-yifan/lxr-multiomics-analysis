# LXR Multi-omics Analysis

This repository contains reproducible RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis workflows
used to study ligand- and cell-type–specific LXR signaling in myeloid cells.

## Overview
- RNA-seq downstream analysis based on Data Carpentry instructional materials
- ATAC-seq processing following an external lab pipeline (code not redistributed)
- Emphasis on reproducibility, configuration, and documentation
