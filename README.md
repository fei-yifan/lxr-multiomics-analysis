# LXR Multi-omics Analysis

This repository contains reproducible RNA-seq and ATAC-seq downstream analysis
used to study ligand- and cell-type–specific LXR signaling in myeloid cells.

## Scope
- RNA-seq downstream analysis adapted from Data Carpentry instructional materials
- ATAC-seq processing performed using an external lab pipeline (code not redistributed)
- Additional downstream analysis, visualization, and documentation

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` – analysis notes and workflow documentation
- `scripts/` – custom scripts for downstream analysis and visualization
- `config.yaml` – analysis configuration parameters
- `CREDITS.md` – third-party materials and acknowledgements

## Notes
This repository focuses on analysis organization, documentation, and reproducibility,
rather than development of primary processing pipelines.
