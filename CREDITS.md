## ATAC-seq Processing and Analysis

ATAC-seq processing and primary analysis were performed using a pipeline developed by
an external research laboratory. The original pipeline code is **not redistributed**
in this repository.

This repository contains:
- documentation of the ATAC-seq workflow and key parameters
- downstream analysis steps and minor adaptations applied after pipeline completion

All credit for the core ATAC-seq processing and analysis belongs to the original developers.
Further details are provided in `docs/atac.md`.
